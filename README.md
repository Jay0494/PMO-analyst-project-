## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, my team and I were tasked with assisting product managers in analyzing data to guide decision-making.

Since no real dataset was available, I researched Nigerian investment behavior and **developed a Python script to simulate realistic investment trends**. This simulated dataset allowed us to build insights as if we were working with real industry data.

The final output is a **Stakeholders Analytical Report**, which outlines user demographics, platform performance, and strategic recommendations for product managers.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Profile typical Nigerian investors based on age, income, and occupation.
2. Identify how users select investment platforms and allocate funds.
3. Compare the performance of major investment platforms (returns, fees, liquidity).
4. Provide insights to guide product positioning, partnerships, and growth strategies.

## 📊 Data Simulation

### Why Simulated Data?

* No real historical datasets were accessible.
* To maintain project realism, we generated synthetic but research-grounded data.

### Simulation Process

1. **Research Phase**

   * Studied Nigerian FinTech platforms such as **PiggyVest, Risevest, and Bamboo**.
   * Collected information on ROI ranges, fees, liquidity restrictions, and user demographics.

2. **Python Script for Data Generation**

   * Created a dataset of **1,000 users** and **2,400 investment records**.
   * Captured:

     * Demographics: Age group, income level, occupation.
     * Investment details: Platform, investment amount, expected returns, fees, withdrawal penalties.
     * Performance outcomes: 6-month and 12-month projected returns.

3. **Validation**

   * Ensured distributions matched realistic market patterns (e.g., more users in the 25–34 age group, typical return ranges for platforms).

## 📈 Key Findings

### Demographic Trends

* **Young adults (25–34)** were the most active investors.
* **Students and freelancers** showed high adoption potential for flexible, low-entry products.

### Platform Performance

* **Bamboo** attracted low-income users (₦50k and below).
* **PiggyVest** was preferred by high-income earners (₦500k+).
* **Risevest** appealed to mid-income users with competitive ROI.
* **Traditional banks** retained popularity due to trust, despite lower ROI.

### Return vs. Cost Dynamics

* While **Risevest** and **Bamboo** showed strong ROI, their advantage was reduced by fees and withdrawal restrictions.
* **High fees and hidden charges** emerged as a major barrier to investment adoption.

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Product Innovation**

   * Tiered investment products for different income brackets.
   * Clear fee and penalty breakdowns in app interfaces.

2. **Partnership Strategy**

   * Collaborations with **universities** and **freelancer groups** to reach young earners.
   * Explore partnerships between **traditional banks** and **FinTechs**.

3. **Financial Education**

   * In-app calculators and gamified financial learning tools.

4. **Platform Improvements**

   * Reduce hidden charges and simplify withdrawals.
   * Offer **personalized investment recommendations**.

## 🚀 Business Impact

* **User Growth:** Potential 20–30% increase by targeting students & freelancers.
* **Revenue:** Transparency expected to drive reinvestments and retention.
* **Market Leadership:** The platform can bridge trust (banks) and innovation (FinTechs).

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Launch a **beta pilot** with students and freelancers.
2. Secure **partnerships** with leading FinTechs and one Nigerian bank.
3. Expand dataset with **real transaction data**.
4. Marketing campaign positioning the platform as **transparent, reliable, and user-friendly**.

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions

* Stable market conditions.
* Users keep funds invested for the full 6M/12M.
* Platforms disclose accurate fees and penalties.
* Dataset is representative of Nigerian investors.

### Constraints

* Dataset is **simulated, not real**.
* Only **6M and 12M horizons** considered.
* No macroeconomic shocks (inflation, currency devaluation) modeled.
* Fees/penalties modeled as flat percentages.
* Limited platform coverage (PiggyVest, Risevest, Bamboo, banks).
